In AppleSNBFBUserClient::start(), the command handler AppleMEClientController::doCmdAction() 
would be called with selector 0x100. Firstly a queue will be created by 
AppleMEClientController::createQueue(). Subsequently, the queue would be 
appended to a linkd list attached to the IOService AppleMEClientController object. Then, 
the controller would map a segment of kernel memory of size 0x1000 into the current task.

Unluckily, the map routine IOMemoryDescriptor::createMappingInTask() could be failed.
Once failed the queue would be destroyed, via free(), but it would never be removed 
from the controllerâ€™s linked list. And when AppleSNBFBUserClient::start() is triggered
again, it will use the last freed queue object to link the new created queue.
